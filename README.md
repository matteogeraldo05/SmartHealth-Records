## Inspiration
Creating a more cost-effective, and efficient healthcare application to store and manage staff and patient data as well as medical records.

## What it does
Securely stores and manages patient and staff data, and utilizes AI to assist healthcare professionals. 

## How we built it
We used Python to handle the GUI and patient data management, and then various Microsoft Azure tools to manage the data storage, speech recognition, and AI aspects of the program.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning how to use Azure tools was a considerable learning curve. We had challenges with the implementation of AI, and security measures. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our speech-to-text system, GUI, and our functional database!

## What we learned
We learned a lot about the implementation of databases, and other developer tools.

## What's next for SmartHealth Records
We will implement AI solutions to improve the user experience and perform predictive analytics based on the data in each patient file, and many more applications! We will also implement the security measures, such as data encryption and secure data transfer.
